go in src, make.
if make does not work, good luck. edit Makefile.
play by running fachoda.x11 or .sdl or .cl
drop me a mail at rixed@free.fr if you really need help.

If make complains about esd.h, just do a 'touch esd.h' in
src directory, and play with the 'nosound' option.

If make can't build either sdl or clanlib version of fachoda,
it will stop with an error message. Just type 'make x11' or
'make sdl' or 'make fachodasrv' to build things separately.

If make complains about the X11 lib, just modify the path to
X11 libs in Makefile, line 32. On some distribs, the right
path is '-L/usr/X11R6/lib', on others '-L/usr/lib/X11' ...

Email me if you encounter any problem (rixed@free.fr)
