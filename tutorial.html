 <h2>Lesson 1: Take off</h2>
 <p>At the beginning of the game you start parked on your home base
(unless you started the game in <i>kill&rsquo;em all</i> mode which should not
require you to take off nor land). There are 4 camps fighting each other
in the game, and each camp have several bases at disposal. Other bots of
your side may be assigned to the same home base and you should take care
not to hurt them or both will explode (did you knew planes were like
nitroglycerin flasks?)</p>
 <p>By pressing one time the `+` your plane will start to move
gently froward. Use brakes to slow down if you need to (`B` key).
By moving the mouse cursor right and left you should be able to
point your nose toward the zebras at the end of the runway. Once
there, brake and align the plane with the runway.</p>
 <p>Deploy the flaps with the `F` key, focus on the instrument panel
(insert key) to check that the corresponding led is on. Then, keep
`+` pressed until full throttle.</p>
 <p>The plane will quickly gain speed. You must now to something quite
unnatural: you must push the mouse cursor toward the top of the window
to lower the plane nose, in order to level the plane horizontally and top
the wings lift.</p>
 <p>Quickly after that, you should feel a last bounce and start
a smooth ascension. Take extra care not to perform any abrupt maneuver
that could make your plane lost it&rsquo;s speed or lift while you are still
close to the ground.</p>
 <p>Here is a quick video showing a quick take off with a Dewoitine:</p>

 <h2>Lesson 2: The instrument panel</h2>
 <p>You won&rsquo;t be able to control the plane without looking regularly at
the instrument panel, so you&rsquo;d better get familiar quickly. The most important
instruments are located on the upper row and give information regarding your
speed, which is the most important parameter, and comes in two variant : the linear
speed, aka the speed of the airflow along the plane, and the vertical speed,
which gives the speed of the ground relative to the plane.</p>
 <p>Even while fighting other planes you should always consider the ground
as your worst opponent!</p>
 <p>The following video explain what most of the flight instruments does:</p>
